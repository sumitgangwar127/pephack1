# pephack1

In this script i use puppeteer PUPPETEER for automating youtube. On execution, the script starts to track the **VIDEO VIEWS,LIKES, DISLIKES and VIEWS MENTION** on title of Target video. After that
It compare them both ( if video views are more then title views then the script updates the title with the current video views).
The script the do the same thing again and again till we stop the script.

The next feature to add in this script is to deploy code on online server so that this code can work 24/7 automatically.
